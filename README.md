Hi All;
I'm Andrew WS Ainger and I'm interested in IoT in Africa (so that's SigFox & LoraWan?)
We currently are using SMS but ftp are also available to us.
The website I am currently involved in is: www.WellMonitorinhgService.co.uk
I'm looking to collaborate with 'Arduinoeers' who have experience with Lora or Sigfox.
Also, we need to make a simple mobile app that contains just five data points that are updated from <100 hand-pumped water wells every day.
I can be contacted at andrewainger@hotmail.com but please put AWSOM yes that's AWSOM in the title.
Many thanks.
Andrew
